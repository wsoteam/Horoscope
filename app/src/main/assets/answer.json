You may even hear from old friends or contacts during this time.To end the month, a full moon in your solar sixth house rises in the night of the twenty-seventh. This can make you extremely productive, and it may have you finishing up an important project for your employer. If you\u2019re looking for a new job, you could see one appear at this time.This same luminary could instead turn your attention to your health, fitness, or diet, so if something pops up, handle it now.

This holds true for you even when a square formed between Saturn in the Water-bearing sign and Uranus in your neighboring sign of Taurus on February 17, June 14, and December 24.

You are working out karmic cycles through learning your own patterns in communication and understanding what stories you've been told for far too long. You might even be faced with the truth about a family situation that you once spent far too much time trying to resolve. Maybe you've sacrificed your own happiness for the good of your loved ones only to come to terms with what you really want for yourself.\n\nThis is a year where you can really step into your own independence and gain a little emotional space from the judgments of others. There's a refreshing tone to your life once you accept the truth about something you've been stuffing under the rug. 2021, in general, is a time for you to face the music, and see how special you really are!

The only problem is sitting still and letting yourself have some fun along the way!\n\nA major aspect this year is your tenth house and fourth house being influenced by the current nodal transits as well as the lunar eclipses. The moon\u2019s north node of fate transits through Gemini and sits high in your zone of career development, asking you to enjoy life a little more even as you are often obsessed with staying in control. The south node in Sagittarius asks you to let go of what no longer serves your soul and wants you to let go of any false narratives that have held you back.\n\nMore specifically, your energy is tied to the May 26 total lunar eclipse, the June 10 annular solar eclipse, the November 19 partial lunar eclipse, and the December 4 total solar eclipse. These dates can help you set a schedule and look at the actual patterns unfolding in your life at these specific times. You're going to be challenged to the max, but you will find your way through your own destined path. Your earthy sign is being given a lot of chances to prove yourself this year, as you are meant to fully thrive in all realms of life, love, and business.\n",

If you\u2019re suddenly feeling uncertain about where you stand with a lover, or you sense that you aren\u2019t on the same page, this would be a good time to review and reevaluate your interactions. Take the time to patiently discuss where each of you is coming from.The sun blazes into your solar sixth house of productivity on the eighteenth, promising a very busy pace of work in the weeks ahead. Venus also swirls forward into this same sector beginning on February 25, assuring pleasant relations with co-workers and clients.However, as you near the end of the month, a full moon in your solar twelfth house appears on the twenty-seventh.

You might even consider directing your energy towards more humanitarian causes as Saturn's presence in Aquarius trines your sign and connects you to several causes that you feel most passionate about.\n\nYou are a sign that seeks diplomacy and justice, which you know does not happen overnight.

You might even consider volunteering your time with certain organizations, and find yourself continually inspired by the stories of others as you deepen your understanding and research within your community.\n\nA very enlightening lesson this year includes the cycles of Mercury retrograde, which are all in air signs. This begins with an Aquarian retrograde during the months of January and February, creating an editing period for your fifth house, affecting your children and creative talents. As Mercury retrograde asks us all to investigate things more deeply, this is also an important lesson for all your relationships.\n\nYou'll feel more challenged by a Gemini retrograde cycle from May through early July. This can be a bit tricky in your communication style, and bring unwanted confusion. The year also brings a healing Mercury retrograde in your sign of the Scales from late September through mid-November.\n\nIn general, there's a lot of activity in the second half of the year in terms of questions and resolutions involving love.\n",

You are experiencing a new world for yourself, and might even long for things to go back to the way they were. But the innovative influence of Aquarius will have you feeling more emotionally detached from your partnerships and friendships, pulling you into the future!\n\nAs a sign who often puts work over love, this can be a little easier for those Goats who just want some energy to jump into their professional life with zero constraints. For those who are ignoring your relationship duties because work gets in the way, this is a year where you can truly come face-to-face in this respect, and be open about your feelings.\n\nThere is some pattern that needs to be reassessed in your overall life. The difficult square between Saturn in Aquarius and Uranus in Taurus takes you away from the original structure you once perceived to be the rules, and now asks you to be a little more radical and step out of your own way. The turning points this year are not limited to mid-February, mid-June, and late December, but do bring on these squares in strong. This is a lesson that will test your self-esteem, but that is meant to cleanse your second chakra of creativity.\n",
